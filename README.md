A personal introductory project to machine learning, this program is capable of identifying drawings using a convolutional neural network.

Currently the .exe is unstable, so I recommend launching from an IDE. VS2017 is my preferred IDE.

Instructions on use are available in /NumberDetector/README/README.md
